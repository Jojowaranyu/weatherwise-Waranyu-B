        "*   The WeatherWise assistant UI was successfully updated to include a text input field for user questions and an \"Ask Question\" button.\n",
        "*   A function `parse_weather_question` was implemented to use an AI model to extract key information (location, time period, weather attribute) from a natural language question, returning the results in a JSON format.\n",
        "*   A function `generate_weather_response` was created to take the parsed question and available weather data, construct a prompt for an AI model, and generate a natural language response based on the data.\n",
        "*   The handler for the \"Ask Question\" button was updated to orchestrate the process: it retrieves the user's question, calls `parse_weather_question`, determines the effective location (from the question or input field), fetches 6 days of weather data using `get_weather_data`, calls `generate_weather_response` with the parsed data and fetched weather, and displays the AI's response in the output area.\n",
        "*   Error handling was included for cases where no question or location is provided, or if weather data fetching fails.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Further refinement of the `parse_weather_question` and `generate_weather_response` functions is needed to improve AI accuracy in understanding user intent and generating more contextually relevant responses based on the available weather data.\n",
        "*   Consider adding more specific data filtering within `generate_weather_response` based on the parsed `time_period` and `weather_attribute` to provide more precise information to the AI and potentially improve the quality of the generated response.\n"
